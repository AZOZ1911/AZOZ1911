## About Me

ELV and Network Engineer focused on Automation, Monitoring, and Infrastructure Reliability.

I work on building practical tools that support:
- Network and device monitoring
- System health checks
- Alerting and incident detection
- Operational support for ELV and IT environments

My approach is hands-on and production-oriented, not tutorial-based.
